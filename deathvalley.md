Badwater basin (not at all bad) is almost 300 ft below the sea level. Do check out the sea level sign in the nearby mountain. The place was surprisingly beautiful. Besieged by the vast landscape of white salt crust and bounded by the far reached mountains, I was feeling heavenly. Remembering the taste of salt...
